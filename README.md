# Advent of Code 2022
I am attempting [these puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2022) with javascript and typescript. I just want to solve the puzzle, I doubt any of these solutions will be very elegant.

Use ts-node to compile typescript without generating any output files.

Example usage.
 `npx ts-node puzzles/3.ts`

Day 3 Update: typescript slows everything down because of compiler errors that aren't very useful.
going back to vanilla js for now.
